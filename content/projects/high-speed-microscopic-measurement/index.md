A high-speed microscopic measuring method and system has been established in this project to test motion states and dynamic characteristics of microactuators. Movement of actuators can be captured by high-speed CMOS/CCD (240 fps) combined with optical microscope when a sub-pixel motion analysis software is utilized to analysis the video. In this way, dynamic characteristics of microactuators such as deflection, amplitude, displacement, moving trail, etc. can be acquired. This optical testing method features non-destruction, non-contact, high-speed, and high-precision.

As is known to all, pixel is the smallest unit of CMOS/CCD imaging traditionally. However, using sub-pixel fitting is an efficient way to break this limit. Based on this, a high-precision testing system whose minimum resolution is 0.1m has been established. Figure 2 shows the procedures of using the sub-pixel fitting based analysis software (time-axis).

The time-axis analysis software (as shown in Figure 3) based on sub-pixel fitting and Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) can output the relationship between time and feature point’s displacement, thus the amplitude and frequency of microactuators can be derived accurately. Similar to this time-axis analysis software, spatial-axis analysis software which shows the moving trail of micro-actuators’ feature point has been constructed as well.  
Due to its advantages, the measuring method and system established in this project is expected to improve the quality of microactuators’ testing and be widely used in research of MEMS.</h8>
