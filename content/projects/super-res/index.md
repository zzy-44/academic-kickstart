## Summary

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  A new far-field super-resolution method for optical microscopic imaging is proposed based on narrow-band filtered annular light-cone illumination with high numerical aperture. In this method, only a part of transmitted light (εN.A.-N.A., ε is the ratio of inner diameter to outer diameter of this annular light-cone’ cross section) can participate in imaging through objectives. MATLAB simulations have been carried out when ε is 0, 0.6, and 0.9 respectively (as shown in the above figure, ε = 450 nm, N.A. = 1.25) based on the scalar diffraction theory. According to the results, the intensity with full width at half maxima (FWHM) significantly decreases with the increase in ε. As a result, the diffraction limit has been broken. Further experiments are under performing.
