## Summary
<img src="Fig_1.png" alt="" width="600px" height="600px"/>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
A new far-field super-resolution optical microscopic imaging method is proposed based on narrow-band filtered annular light-cone illumination with high numerical aperture. Only a part of transmitted light ($\epsilon$N.A.-N.A., $\epsilon$ is the ratio of inner diameter to outer diameter of this annular light-cone) can participate in imaging through objective. According to the scalar diffraction theory, MATLAB simulations have been carried out when $\epsilon$=0, 0.6, 0.9 (shown in figure above, $\lambda$=450nm, N.A.=1.25). Apparently, full width at half maxima (FWHM) of the intensity can significantly decrease with the increase in $\epsilon$, as a result, the diffraction limit has been broken. Further experiments are under performing.
